# Flight Ticket Price Calculation By Ihsan Melih Sisman

  <br> Make a program that calculates air ticket prices according to distance and conditions with Java. Get Distance (KM),
<br>    age and trip type (One Way, Round-Round) information from the user. Take the fare per distance as 0.10 TL / km. First,
<br>    calculate the total price of the flight and then apply the following discounts to the customer according to the conditions;
<br>
<br>       Values received from the user must be valid (distance and age are positive numbers, trip type is 1 or 2). Otherwise,
 <br>       "You Have Entered Wrong Data!" A warning should be given.
 <br>
 <br>       If the person is younger than 12 years old, 50% discount is applied on the ticket price.

  <br>      If the person is between the ages of 12-24, a 10% discount is applied on the ticket price.
  <br>
  <br>    If the person is over 65 years old, a 30% discount is applied on the ticket price.

 <br>    This extra day (leap day) is obtained by adding February 29 to February, which is normally 28 days.
<br>     How to Calculate a Leap Year?
    <br> As a general rule, leap years are years that are a multiple of 4:
  <br>   Like 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024.
   <br>  Years that are a multiple of 100 are leap years that are only divisible by 400 without a remainder:
 <br>    For example, the years 1200, 1600, 2000 are leap years, but 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years.
<br>     The reason why only those exactly divisible by 400 are consid
